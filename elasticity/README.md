# Hooke's Law of Elasticity

## Overview
Hooke's Law suggests that the force associated with a spring when it is released is linearly related to the distance it has been compressed. 

An experiment was conducted to capture data for a number of springs across various compression lengths. The indent of the experiment is demonstrate Hooke's Law by showing that the results of the experiment lie on a straight line. Yet experiment data tends not to be perfect so we expect the results to lie around a curved line not necessary on it. 

Could we use the results to fit a model that will allow us to depict the linear premise posited by Hooke? Can we use a linear regression to solve the problem?

## Analysis
This sample notebook is based on the experiment outlined in Chapter 15 of the book [Computation and Programming in Python](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-0).
