    # Popular Hacker News stories analyzed with AlchemyAPI
    
    [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship. It is run by Paul Graham's investment fund and startup incubator, [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).
    
    Hacker News is community based. Articles are posted and upvoted by users. The most popular articles make it to the top of the site. The algorithm that computes the top ranked articles is largely impacted by time, giving new articles a significant boost. After all, it's a news site.
    
    Content that can be submitted to Hacker News is defined as "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity". If you haven't seen the site yet, [check it out](https://news.ycombinator.com/). You can find more details about the Hacker News algorithm in [this blog post](http://amix.dk/blog/post/19574).
    
    If you're already an avid reader of Hacker News you might have wondered **"Is there a topic commonality between the popular Hacker News stories?** or put differently if you're an author - **"What topic do I have to write about to make it to the top of Hacker News?**
    
    This notebook is trying to answer these questions using the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and the [AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/) to get ranked concepts for textual data. Here are the steps we'll take:
    
    1. [Query the most popular Hacker News stories](#Query-the-most-popular-Hacker-News-stories)
    1. [Save the current 500 most popular Hacker News stories](#Save-the-current-500-most-popular-Hacker-News-stories)
    1. [Tag concepts of Hacker News stories using AlchemyAPI](#Tag-concepts-of-Hacker-News-stories-using-AlchemyAPI)
    
    To run this notebook, [register for a free AlchemyAPI account](http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html). After you receive your API key, paste your API key in the cell below:
code 1
    api_key = 'PASTE_ALCHEMY_API_KEY_HERE'
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
markdown
    Import required Python libraries:
code 2
    import requests
    import os
    import pandas as pd
    from datetime import datetime
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
markdown
    ## Query the current 500 most popular Hacker News stories
    
    The [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) provides an end point `topstories` that returns the 500 most highly rated stories at this time.
    
    ### Define Hacker News API request url strings
code 3
    hacker_news_api_base_url = 'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/'
    hacker_news_feature_url_item = 'item/'
    hacker_news_feature_url_topstories = 'topstories'
    hacker_news_api_parameters = '.json?print=pretty'
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
markdown
    ### Define Hacker News API helper functions
code 4
    def get_story_for_id(story_id):
        ''' Queries the Hacker News API for story information about for the given story_id. '''
        story_request_url = hacker_news_api_base_url + hacker_news_feature_url_item + unicode(story_id) + hacker_news_api_parameters
        story = requests.get(story_request_url).json()
        return story
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
code 5
    def get_story_details(story):
        ''' Filter relevant story information from the given Hacker News API story object. '''
        # remove descendants from story (e.g. comments), because we don't use them
        if 'kids' in story: del story['kids']
        # encode text field content as ascii (work around IPython defect https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/6799)
        if 'title' in story: story['title'] = story['title'].encode('ascii', 'ignore')
        if 'text' in story: story['text'] = story['text'].encode('ascii', 'ignore')
        if 'url' in story: story['url'] = story['url'].encode('ascii', 'ignore')
        return story
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
code 6
    def get_all_story_details(story_ids):
        ''' Queries Hacker News API for relevant story information for given list of story_ids. '''
        all_story_details = []
        for story_id in story_ids:
            all_story_details.append(get_story_details(get_story_for_id(story_id)))
        return all_story_details
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": false
    }
markdown
    ### Query stories
    
    With these helper functions in place, let's query the Hacker News API for the current top 500 stories:
code 7
    current_top_500_stories_url = hacker_news_api_base_url + hacker_news_feature_url_topstories + hacker_news_api_parameters
    current_top_500_stories = requests.get(current_top_500_stories_url).json()
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": false
    }
markdown
    Take a look at what we got to make sure we have a list of story ids:
code 8
    current_top_500_stories
  execute_result

    ## Save the current 500 most popular Hacker News stories
    
    The top 500 stories provided by the Hacker News API are a snapshot that reflect the currently most popular stories. To enable an analysis of the most popular stories over time, it is helpful to work with a larger corpus of stories.  
    
    ### Define story persistence helper function
    
    Let's save the story ids on disk for future usage with the Python [pickle](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html) library provided by Pandas convenience methods [read_pickle](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/generated/pandas.io.pickle.read_pickle.html) and [to_pickle](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_pickle.html):
code 9
    story_ids_file_name = 'hacker_news_story_ids.pickle'
    
    def update_saved_story_ids(story_ids, story_ids_file_name):
        ''' Read story ids from disk, merge with given story_ids, and save back to disk. '''
        file_story_ids = []
        try:
            file_story_ids = pd.read_pickle(story_ids_file_name)
        except IOError as err:
            # file for story ids does not yet exist, move on
            pass
        merged_story_ids = set(file_story_ids).union(set(story_ids))
        pd.Series(list(merged_story_ids)).to_pickle(story_ids_file_name)
        return merged_story_ids
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
code 10
    story_ids_up_until_today = update_saved_story_ids(current_top_500_stories, story_ids_file_name)
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": false
    }
markdown
    ### Query story details
    
    Query details about all stories (e.g. title, url of linked article, publish time, score, number of descendenants). Let's see for how many stories we're going query details:
code 11
    len(story_ids_up_until_today)
  execute_result
  - text/plain
    1053
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": false
    }
markdown
    Now, query the details and show a sample of the first five stories (If you happen to hit JSON errors, try running the cell again, as these seem to happen intermittently):
code 14
    all_story_details = get_all_story_details(list(story_ids_up_until_today))
    # optionally, comment the first line and uncomment the two lines below to use a subset of stories to work with to reduce subsequent API requests against AlchemyAPI
    # top_10_stories = list(story_ids_up_until_today)[0:10]
    # all_story_details = get_all_story_details(top_10_stories)
    stories_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(all_story_details)
    stories_df.head(5)
  execute_result
  - text/plain

    ## Tag concepts of Hacker News stories using AlchemyAPI
    
    One of the features provided by AlchemyAPI is [Concept Tagging](http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/concept/urls.html). It allows extracting concepts from web-based content available at a given URL. We're going to apply concept tagging to the URLs from the Hacker News stories.
    
    ### Define AlchemyAPI request URL strings
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
code 15
    alchemy_api_base_url = 'http://access.alchemyapi.com/calls/url/'
    alchemy_api_parameters = '?apikey=' + api_key + '&outputMode=json&url='
    alchemy_feature_url_concepts = "URLGetRankedConcepts"
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": true
    }
markdown
    ### Define AlchemyAPI helper functions
    
    Implement a function to query the AlchemyAPI for concepts for a given url:
code 16
    def get_concepts_for_url(story_url, story_urls_and_concepts):
        ''' Query AlchemyAPI concept tagging for given url and add result to given story_urls_and_concepts dictionary. '''
        if story_url in story_urls_and_concepts:
            # attempt to get concepts for story url from disk 
            concepts = story_urls_and_concepts.get(story_url)
        else:
            # no concepts available on disk for story url, query AlchemyAPI for concepts and add save for future use
            request_url = alchemy_api_base_url + alchemy_feature_url_concepts + alchemy_api_parameters + story_url
            concepts = requests.get(request_url).json()
            story_urls_and_concepts[story_url] = concepts
        return concepts
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": false
    }
markdown
    Let's test the function by running it against a `test_url` pointing to an article from cnn.com:
code 17
    story_urls_and_concepts = {}
    test_url = 'http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/01/13/missing.pilot/index.html'
    get_concepts_for_url(test_url, story_urls_and_concepts)

    You should see a JSON document containing list of `concepts` extracted from the website at the given url. Each `concept` is identified by the `text` and is assigned a `relevance` which measures how confident AlchemyAPI is that the website is talking about this `concept`. Based on the identified concept, the JSON also contains links to publicly available knowledge bases [DBPedia](http://dbpedia.org/) and [Yago](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/yago/). Feel free to test AlchemyAPI concept tagging for articles that you're interested in by replacing the `test_url`.
    
    The free price tier for AlchemyAPI allows 1000 queries per day. To reduce the number of AlchemyAPI query requests, we create a dictionary `story_urls_and_concepts` to store the story url with the list of detected concepts:
code 26
    story_urls_and_concepts_file_name = 'story_urls_and_concepts.pickle'
    
    try:
        story_urls_and_concepts = pd.read_pickle(story_urls_and_concepts_file_name)
    except IOError as err:
        # file for story urls and concepts does not yet exist, move on
        story_urls_and_concepts = {}
        pass
  metadata
    {
     "collapsed": false
    }
markdown
    Now that we can extract concepts for articles at a given url we need to extract the concepts for a Hacker News `story_id`. For each identified concept we need to keep track how often and from what story it was extracted. We need to aggregate popularity measures like score and number of descendants from the stories. 
    
    The resulting data structure is a dictionary of dictionaries containing the following information:
    
    ```
    {
    'Programming language': {
      concept_dict {
        'occurs' : 11    # there are 10 occurrences of the concept 'Programming language' in our stories
        'score'  : 543   # aggregated score of all stories containing concept 'Progamming language' is 543
        'ids'    : [123,456] # story ids of all stories containing concept 'Programming language'
        'descendants' 94  # aggregated number of all descendants of all stories containing 'Progamming language'
        'links' : ['www.cnn.com/programming_language', ... ]  # links to all stories about 'Progamming language'
      }
    }
    }
            
    ```
    
    The following function aggregates all this information about all concepts extracted from all stories:
code 27
    def get_concepts_for_id(story_id, all_concepts_dicts, story_urls_and_concepts):
        ''' Extracts concepts for given story_id and aggregates story popularity information. '''
        print "Querying concepts for story " + unicode(story_id) + "..."
        request_url = hacker_news_api_base_url + hacker_news_feature_url_item + unicode(story_id) + hacker_news_api_parameters
        print(request_url)
        story = requests.get(request_url).json()
        # ignore "Ask HN" and job posts, only consider actual stories
        if story.get('type') == 'story':
            # make sure story has url that links to article
            if story.get('url') is not None:
                # extract concepts using AlchemyAPI
                concept_result = get_concepts_for_url(story.get('url'), story_urls_and_concepts)
                if concept_result['status'] == 'OK':
                    concepts = concept_result.get('concepts')
                    for concept in concepts:
                        # check, if we previously encountered the concept in another article
                        concept_dict = {}
                        concept_text = concept.get('text')

    Let's test the `get_concepts_for_id` helper function by providing it a valid Hacker News story id:
code 28
    all_concepts_dicts = {}
    test_story_id = 9226497
    all_concepts_dicts = get_concepts_for_id(test_story_id, all_concepts_dicts, story_urls_and_concepts)

    You should see a dictionary of concepts with links to stories, score and descendant information. Feel free to enter different `test_story_id`s.
    
    Now that we know our `get_concepts_for_id` function works, let's query and aggregate the concepts for all Hacker News stories:

    Save the `story_urls_and_concepts` dictionary to disk for future use. The dictionary got created and updated while iterating through all `story_id`s and is valueable at this point, because it contains the concepts from querying the AlchemyAPI, which supports a limited number of requests per day. Without saving the `story_urls_and_concepts` to disk, we would hit that 1000 requests per day limit after just a few days of collecting story ids.

    You can be the judge whether these are the topics you would have expected to be on top. As you run this notebook over time, more stories will be available. You can also run this `Hacker News and AlchemyAPI.ipynb` notebook recurringly every day by running the notebook `Hacker News Runner.ipynb`. This will aggregate data over time and allow for more detailed analysis. 
    
    In this notebook we showed the usage of the Hacker News API and the AlchemyAPI. We used the AlchemyAPI concept tagging feature to extract topics from the Hacker News stories. Finally, we sorted aggregated popularity information about the stories for each concept and showed it in a tabular form sorted by different popularity measures.
    
    The invocation of the AlchemyAPI was rather simple. A lot of the code to write intermediate result to disk is to work around the 1000 requests per day limitation.
    
    Concept detection is only one feature of the AlchemyAPI. Check out more features in the [API documentation](http://www.alchemyapi.com/api).
